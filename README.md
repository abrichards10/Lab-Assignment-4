# Lab-Assignment-4

    // Give an outer array of 'k' inner arrays

    // Basically our goal is to merge and return all inner arrays into one sorted output array

    // So we want to loop through the inner arrays
    // and since they're already sorted
    // we just compare the first values to each other
    // move on if they're bigger, and add to output array if smaller
    // requires a merge function similar to that of the mergeSort method
    // we are comparing the left & right subarrays (even if there are more than 2 arrays being compared)
