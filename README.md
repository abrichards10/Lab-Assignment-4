# Lab-Assignment-4

    // Give an outer array of 'k' inner arrays

    // Basically our goal is to merge and return all inner arrays into one sorted output array

    // So we want to loop through the inner arrays
    // and since they're already sorted
    // we just compare the first values to each other
    // move on if they're bigger, and assign the new 'smallest' if they're smaller
